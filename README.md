Fooling around with my X220 repo had me wanting more,
so i've decided to mobo transplat an Framework mainboard into a X201 chassie
with a few mods/upgrades.
My new go to distro for the time being is "Pop_OS" because it's polished.
feels well integrated and has emense support.

TLDR: Mission is to drop an framework mobo into an X201( basically a Framework/nb51 X2100 )

**Stuff 2do:**
* **Red ThinkLight mod**
* **Internal USB** - attach RTL8812AU. 
* **Speaker mod** - Samsung note 10 or Ipad 11" pro speakers
* **Mechanical keyboard fold out feet** - for extra cooling
* **Antenna mod** - Good ol mods
* **Custom I/O PCB daugther boards** - still looking into this
* **Framework mainboard bracket** - Get mobo from their outlet
* **convert CN2 keyboard bus connecter** - Keeping the lenovo keyboard ofc.
* **Adapt LVDS panel for mainboard** - (Convert eDP to LVDS if necessary)
